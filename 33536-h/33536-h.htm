REPORT,<br /><br />

<small><i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i></small></h2>


<p>Were any apology necessary for this
Report, a sufficient one would be where Major
Hart says, "When I add that Major-general
Macaulay was my junior officer; that, in consequence
of my dismission, he succeeded to the
very regiment which, at this hour, I should have
otherwise commanded, and became a general
officer so much sooner by my dismission; I am
satisfied that the Honourable Court (of Directors)
will think his conduct a <i>most material</i>
feature in the future consideration of my case."&mdash;India-House-Papers,
p. 362.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Another instance of Major Hart's sinister
attack is, where Major-general Macaulay has
replied to it, saying, "There remains a
farther slanderous insinuation of Major Hart's,
that I think myself bound to notice. He has
charged upon me, as a leading motive in the censure
of his conduct, a settled design of placing
myself in the command of the fortress of Palamcottah,
and of the forces in the field in Tinnevelly,
to his exclusion! This strange charge
he more than once gave distinct hints of to myself.
But he made it directly in the course of
his last visit to me, in June 1815, when he behaved
so coarsely. It will, I have little doubt,
seem somewhat strange, even to your Lordship,
(Harris, the commander-in-chief,) but so it is,
that to this hour I do not know to whom I owe
that command. <i>I not only never made application
directly or indirectly for it, but the idea of
applying for it never once entered my mind.</i>&mdash;Papers,
p. 388.</p>

<p>But Major-general Macaulay scarce needed
this reply, since it is Major Hart himself who
can affirm his own error. The Major says,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
"I shall not however pretend to defend the act
<i>acknowledged</i> of my having carried to the field a
quantity of private grain.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> No, my Lord,
(Harris,) most deeply and sensibly do I feel
and deplore the <i>error</i> of my conduct.&mdash;Papers,
p. 352.</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding this <i>pretended</i> acknowledgment
of <i>real</i> error, it is the Board of
Controul which, in order to allow Major Hart
to hold private grain, must set aside the very
regulation upon this subject. The 39th Regulation
says, "it being the principle of the present
system, by liberal and avowed allowances,
to place this department upon so respectable a
footing as to leave no temptation to seek for
unauthorized advantages, the Commissary of
Grain is not on any account, directly or indirectly,
to derive any other advantage or emolument
from this situation than the <i>salary</i> fixed by
Government. The strictest economy is, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
to be observed in every expense attending
this department; and the disbursements and
accounts of the Commissary are to be attested
on honour, as prescribed in the forms annexed
to these Regulations.&mdash;Papers, p. 17.</p>

<p>And the mighty Board of Controul, besides
allowing Major Hart to hold private grain, and
therefore to reap the attendant profit on it <i>with
perfect security</i>, next considers this both as <i>another
question</i> and as <i>not another question</i>. Thus
the Board having said "whether he (Major
Hart) ought to have derived any profit upon the
original price of the rice, so in his possession,
is another question," can yet add, "but <i>suppose
he ought not</i>, when he<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> openly supplied it to
our army, and was contented with much less
(profit) than he might have obtained with perfect
security, we cannot think it a crime of the
blackest die.&mdash;Papers, p. 232.</p>

<p>The Board continues "this, and the circumstance
of his silence, from the 16th to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
22d of April, appear to us the only points of
doubt in the whole case, and a conduct doubtful
only on two such points does not, in our
contemplation, warrant the sentence<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
that has been passed upon it, with the consequences to
his fortune and honour to which it has led."
Papers, p. 232.</p>

<p>But, "in our contemplation" of this "whole
case," there are yet to be noticed other two
grand points of doubt. And first, as Lord
Harris writes, "it was not the loss of rice in
the department of the Commissary of Grain
<i>alone</i> that so seriously affected the general
store of provision for the army, but," again,
secondly, "that infinitely more extensive and
entirely unexpected deficiency which was discovered,
on the 16th of April, in the quantity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
carried by bullocks, hired in the Ceded
Districts, under the authority of Lieutenant-Colonel
Read, and of which Captain Macleod
was in the general superintendance."</p>

<p>Lord Harris explains, saying "Captain
Macleod, to whom no report of material loss
had been made by the carriers on the 3d of
April, had, on the 5th, given me a report, of
which a copy is enclosed, by which it appeared
that rice, the property of government, sufficient
for the consumption of 30,000 men, at
half a seer per day, for six-and-thirty days,
was then in camp, independently of nearly an
equal quantity reported by the benjarries (bullock-owners)
to be in their possession, and
which they had been ordered to retain for the
public service. No issues had been authorized
from this stock, and the belief that it
existed prevented my feeling any uneasiness
on the subject of provisions, although I knew
the amount in <i>Major Hart's</i> charge was nearly
expended. The measurement of the rice on
the 15th of April, in the course of delivery (not
by, observe, because) to Major Hart, produced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the <small>FIRST</small> suspicion of this enormous
deficiency, and the report of it, when ascertained
the succeeding day, the consequent
alarm." Papers, p. 75.</p>

<p>Nor is Lord Harris here alluding towards
the whole, but rather to the close of Captain
Macleod's Report, where it is stated that "the
private and public rice would feed 30,000
men for thirty-three (or, as Lord Harris says,
thirty-six) days, exclusive of Major Hart's department.
It is supposed Major Hart has
7000 bullock-loads, which would be ten seers
each to 30,000 men. (Signed) William Macleod,
Superintendant of Supplies." Papers,
p. 82.</p>

<p>From these several extracts we have now to
gather, that if, on the 5th of April, Major Hart
had ten seers each man, equal to ten days
rice, at whole allowance, on the 15th he
would have no bullock-loads, whatever, remaining
"in his possession." Wherefore, from
the 16th of April to the 6th of May, (see in
<a href="#Page_17">page. 17</a>,) and, further, from this last date to
the 18th following, (see in <a href="#Page_18">page 18</a>), the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
fraud on the rice, "then in camp," must have
been, not only "exclusive of Major Hart's
department," but in that of Captain Macleod,
from whose stock "no issues had been authorized."
We have now to observe, that the
real question becomes, not whether Major Hart
could hold private as well as public grain? but,
whether this could be done by Captain Macleod,
and by him after his having returned in
his report both classes of grain as "the property
of government?" And we presume, once
for all, on this nice point, that there will not be
urged the existence of one sort of regulation
for a Commissary of <i>Provisions</i>, as Captain
Macleod is sometimes called, and another for
a Commissiary of <i>Grain</i>, as Major Hart was
always called.</p>

<p>Contending that he ordered his private grain
from Madras, less for the army than for his
private followers of it, Major Hart would rest
his order upon the affidavit of one of those followers,
by name Sadashevah Moodiliar. But
this dubash, or confidential servant, will herein-afterwards
be shown, among other of Major
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Hart's head people, as tampering with Subidar
Enom Beg, during the intervals of this native
soldier's examination by the Committee of
Inquiry.</p>

<p>To proceed more particularly with Captain
Macleod.&mdash;It was he who, having first disclosed
to Major-General Macaulay, (the private
instead of public secretary to Lord Harris,)
that Major Hart had a quantity of private
grain to dispose of, and who, next observing
the surprise with which his communication
was received, does, third, and finally,
request Major-General Macaulay's "permission
to inform Major Hart that he (Major
Hart) must, <i>in future</i>, communicate directly
with me (Major-General Macaulay) upon the
subject." Major-General Macaulay subjoins,
"to this I assented;" but elsewhere explains,
that "with the exception of the conversation
that took place with Captain Macleod, when
he delivered the original message, I held no
communication with Major Hart, but <i>by letter</i>."
Papers, pp. 159 and 158.</p>

<p>Relative, indeed, to Captain Macleod the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Major-General thinks it equally right to explain,
saying "Captain (now Colonel Macleod)
well knows my sentiments of his character.
Long as he has been in England, it has
not happened to me <i>once to meet him</i>. But I
retain my former respect for his integrity."
Papers, p. 369.</p>

<p>It was Captain Macleod who, having said "by
this observation (<i>a slight of hand</i> in receiving
and issuing grain by measure), I do not mean
<i>to attempt</i> to screen the bullock-contractors;"
and added, "who, I am persuaded, <i>in my own
mind</i>, must have embezzled the greatest proportion
of the quantity deficient;" yet does
shortly afterwards release from arrest, at the
sole desire of the bullock-contractors, of all
other men, not indeed a <i>bullock</i>, but yet its
tantamount, a <i>flock</i> contractor, notwithstanding
this, "one of the duffadars, Narnapah by
name, was detected in having <i>concealed</i> seventy
bags of rice in the bazar of the Nizam's camp,
for the purpose of being sold there;" and,
for all that, such seventy bags "were, on
<i>discovery</i>, removed from the Nizam's bazar to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the grain dep&ocirc;t, near head-quarters." Papers,
p. 79.</p>

<p>It was once more Captain Macleod, who
having said, "I impute the deficiencies, generally,
to the corruption of Sechiram," yet does
not confine or arrest this "security for all the
contractors,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> because his holding a jaghire
from government, in the Baramahl was <i>supposed
to be</i> a sufficient hold upon him," or hold,
"which would put it <i>out of his power to elude</i>
any punishment or penalty that might afterwards
be adjudged for his deception." Papers,
p. 77.</p>

<p>And such is the mode of reasoning subscribed
to, rather than implicitly believed in, by
Lord Harris, where his Lordship says, "of
Captain Macleod's merits I have already had
occasion to speak in terms of the highest
praise,<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
and although placed at the head of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
those persons from whose misconduct the most
serious mischief might have proceeded, and
which did actually produce considerable inconvenience
to the army, I hold it incumbent on
me to declare that Captain Macleod is, <i>in no
degree</i>, blamable for this unfortunate business,"
or business, "which <i>no means in his power to
elude</i> could possibly prevent." Papers, p. 75.</p>

<p>We have said,&mdash;subscribed to, rather than
implicitly believed in,&mdash;because Lord Harris
pursues "the principal carriers and benjarries
are now in the Baramahl, (the very place,
observe, of Sechiram's jaghire,) and I recommend
to the immediate attention of government
such measures as it may appear proper to
adopt for recovering from them the amount of
rice embezzled, and punishing those chiefs of
this class of men who stood forward in responsibility,
and who certainly knew and connived
at the disposal of the rice, <i>if they were not
themselves the managers of the transaction</i>."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>We now trust to have amply shown why
Lord Harris thought, 1st, that "it was not
the loss of rice in the department of the Commissary
of Grain alone, that so seriously
affected the general store of provision for the
army;<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
but, 2dly, that infinitely more extensive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and entirely unexpected deficiency, which
was discovered in the quantity carried by
bullocks, hired in the Ceded Districts, under
the authority of Lieutenant-Colonel Read, and
of which <i>Captain Macleod</i> was in the general
superintendance.</p>

<p>Upon this second and last of our own two
points of grand doubt, we shall offer some
further extracts, by which it will be perceived
that Major Hart's head people were ordered
back to the Ceded Districts, in company with
Captain Macleod's benjarries, that is, were
ordered back to those Districts, not before, but
immediately upon the discovery of the fraud,
and, as it were, in consequence of it.</p>

<p>Asked by the Committee of Inquiry, "under
whose charge was your rice brought forward
on the march, and placed at the ground of
encampment?" Major Hart replies, "under
head people employed by myself, whom I discharged
and (though discharged, yet) sent to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Carnatic with <i>General Floyd's</i> detachment."
In like manner, Captain Macleod states, in
one of his letters to government, that "Sechiram
joined the army at Kellamungulum and
remained with it till the march of <i>General
Floyd's</i> division towards Caveriporam, when
all the public and benjarries cattle, which had
at that time survived the campaign, were sent
from the army." Papers, p. 77. And under
date of 18th April, Lord Harris having confirmed
that "<i>Major-General Floyd</i>, with all
the cavalry and three battalions of Native
Infantry, marches to-morrow morning towards
Caveriporam to meet Colonel Read, and escort
his benjarries to camp," explains that "their
arrival is of the utmost consequence, as, on
measuring our bags to ascertain the rice they
really contained, they were found so much
diminished, by loss or fraud, that eighteen days
provisions for the fighting men, at half allowance,
is all that remains in camp; our supplies
must, therefore, arrive before the 6th of May,
to save us from extreme distress." Papers,
p. 49.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Further beyond this coincidence, Captain
Macleod's second of two reports, dated Seringapatam,
29th June, 1799, says, "N.B. The
9025 mercals of rice remained in charge of
Captain Macleod till Seringapatam was taken;
no part of it was issued before the 18th
May. E.E. (Signed) William Macleod, <i>late</i>
Superintendant of Supplies." Notwithstanding,
then, the extreme distress of the army,
as just mentioned by Lord Harris, we here
find Captain Macleod admitting that he was
a holder of three days grain for 30,000 men,
at whole allowance, not before but after the
18th of May. Our inference is, what others
have frequently drawn in this case, that there
was always a plenty rather than ever any
scarcity of grain.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>Finally, we are to produce Major Hart's
dubash, the already mentioned Sadashevah
Moodiliar, as tampering among other of
Major Hart's head people, with Subidar
Enom Beg, during the intervals of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
native soldier's examination by the Committee
of Inquiry.</p>

<p>The Committee says, "from the very exact
concurrence observed throughout the depositions
of the maistries (carriers) and head
owners, (of bullocks,) already examined, it
appears that a further examination of persons
of those descriptions will not tend to afford
any new information on the subject under investigation;
but as the native commissioned
and non-commissioned officers of the details
which were employed with the grain-department
may, from their observation of the conduct
of the maistries and bullock-owners
during the service, be able to speak particularly
to points connected therewith, the Committee
call upon Subidar Enom Beg, of the first
battalion of the 12th regiment of native infantry."
Papers, p. 53.</p>

<p>And having first disproved, in common with
other guards during the march, the alleged
irruptions of the enemy's horse, as counterpleaded
by the benjarries, even in phalanx
form, Subidar Enom Beg, "of his own accord,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
next informs the Committee, that, "about
eleven o'clock in the forenoon of yesterday, the
<i>head conicopoly</i> of the grain-department, by
name Dunnacody, accompanied by a tindall
of lascars attached to the department, came to
his tent and told him that he had been directed
by <span class="smcap">Major Hart</span> to inquire of him the names
of the subidars and jemidars, also the number
of havildars, naigues, and sepoys, which had
been employed with the rice-department; that
he (the subidar) told the conicopoly that two
of the companies were in Seringapatam, and
that the company from Major Tolfrey's battalion,
in camp, consisted of such a number of
havildars, naigues, and sepoys, together with
his own name, and that of the jemidar, all of
which the conicopoly took down, in writing,
and then went away. That in about half an
hour afterwards the conicopoly and tindall
returned, and asked the subidar to come to
Tumboo Naik, <i>one of the principal bullock-owners</i>
and a <span class="smcap">DUBASH</span>, whom he supposed to
be Major Hart's (Sadashevah Moodiliar, the
affidavit-witness,) as they wished to speak to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
him, and to come without dressing himself.
The subidar answered, 'that as he might be
wanted for duty, he could not come without
his commanding-officer's leave,' to which the
conicopoly replied, 'that, as he would probably
be sent for by the Committee sitting near the
general's tent, he desired him to keep favour
upon him,' and the subidar answered, 'he was
in the Company's service and, if sent for, he
should tell what he saw, and could not tell
any lies.' That the subidar was then sent for
by Major Tolfrey, and ordered to come to the
Committee, which he did, and that having attended
the Committee and been ordered by
Colonel Muat (the President) to come again
this morning, he was going to his lines when
<i>one of the maistries</i> meeting him upon the road,
asked, 'what news at the Committee?' The
subidar answered him, 'you have no right to
inquire: I have been to the Committee on
business which does not concern you; go
about your business.'" Papers, pp. 55 and 56.</p>

<p>We would observe upon this testimony of
Enom Beg, that the affidavit-dubash of Major
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Hart, Sadashevah Moodiliar, who is wont to
describe himself as "a writer in charge of the
public servants in the grain-department," is not,
in our opinion, so important a personage as Major
Hart's head conicopoly Dunnacody, and this
because the employment of a head conicopoly
is much more <i>official</i> than that of a dubash,
however greatly any particular occasion, like
the present, for instance, may render the latter's
services desirable. But in India it would
otherwise appear that the dubash is accounted
by far the more important personage of the
two, at least if we can judge from Mr.
Sherson's trial at Madras, also for rice-frauds;
for, on this trial Sir John Newbolt, as third of
three Judges, was pleased to argue, saying,
'Audy Narrain, (the dubash of Mr. Sherson,)
one of the persons offering the bribe, which is
<i>almost tantamount</i> to naming Mr. Sherson himself.'
Even in this case of Major Hart there
is what is not wholly dissimilar to bribery;
namely, where the conicopoly replies, 'that
as he (Enom Beg) would probably be sent for
by the Committee sitting near the general's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
tent, he (the conicopoly) desired him to keep
favour on him.' The frequent occurrence
among native Indians of the word <i>lies</i> is to be
here regarded as an Anglo-Orientalism. It is to
the probability of Enom Beg and his fellow-soldiers'
testimonies over those of Major Hart
and Captain Macleod's head people, that attention
shall safely be paid.</p>

<p>Relative to the benjarries and maistries of
Captain Macleod, as well as to Major Hart's
head people, we must differ from the Committee
of Inquiry, where saying that "a <i>further</i>
examination of persons of those descriptions
will not tend to afford any new information
on the subject." Our cause of
difference is, that neither Sadashevah and
Dunnacody, nor Sechiram and Narnapah,
were <i>ever</i> examined by this Committee.</p>

<p>Major-General Macaulay "cannot conceive,
under the strong case which appears to be made
out, how the government of this country and
Parliament can, <i>with a due regard to character</i>,
abstain from a revision of the whole question."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Neither can we conceive how, in this respect,&mdash;not
the government (of the Board of Controul
and Court of Directors,) but&mdash;Parliament
abstains.</p>

of April,) says "I fear that I shall have no alternative
but to appeal against such daily slander to the laws of
my country." In other words, he, who sought to fight
a duel with Major-Gen. Macaulay, fears. And may
he fear!</p>

<p>But Major Hart dares not appeal to the laws of his
country, were he even slandered after the <i>daily</i> manner
of his own advertisement. Major Hart was too old a
soldier to have to learn, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He who fights and runs away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lives to fight another day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor can Major Hart forget where Major-General
Macaulay states, "Report&mdash;to which, however, I can
scarce give credit&mdash;assigns this disgraceful production
to the pen of a noted Barrister. Be that as it may,
Major Hart stands fully (be this as it may, equally
fully) responsible." Major-General Macaulay's <i>official</i>
statement is, "Major Hart addressed a letter to the
Court of Directors, dated the 22d of last month: that
libellous letter has not yet been printed, by order of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Court of Directors, for the use of the Proprietors; but
Major Hart has thought fit to print and widely to send
it into circulation. I am sorry that it is not inserted in
the Papers respecting the <i>Mandamus</i>; the reason may
be, that the Court of Directors, possibly viewing it in
the light I do, could not have thought it proper to make
themselves accessaries to the circulation of a defamatory
document, unaccompanied by explanations from me.
To that letter from Major Hart was appended a declaration,
under the signature of three General Officers;
Gen. Sir John Floyd (Bart. omitted), Lieut.-Gen.
Brown, and Lieut.-Gen. Bridges, on what these officers
are pleased to term <i>some important points connected
with</i> Major Hart's case. The words in Italics are so
printed in the original."</p>

<p>Proprietors!&mdash;Have you never heard of a "Review
of <i>some important passages</i> in the Administration of Sir
George Barlow, Bart. by Charles Marsh, Esq. M.P.?"
have you never heard that this "noted Barrister" is
the probable author of an anonymous Report of Mr.
Sherson's case, if not of his trial itself, or will you not
hear your own Directors?</p>

<p>"The two following Papers, <i>although private</i>, having
already appeared in print, are here (the Records of
the Company) inserted for the information of the Proprietors;
but it <i>does not</i> appear from (here) the Records
of the Company, that they were ever (during 16
long years) <i>officially</i> communicated to the Court of
Directors." The two Papers are, "A Letter from the
Right Hon. Henry Dundas to David Scott, Esq." a
deceased Director; and an enclosure in the foregoing,
signed "William Dundas," and "T. Wallace;"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
which last paper has actually been called by some <i>A
Report of the Board of Controul</i>. On the other hand,
the deceased Mr. David Scott's authority to correspond
and correspondence do not appear.</p>

<p>So, in Mr. Sherson's case, there has been published an
unsigned or anonymous Report of it, by a Mr. Halhed,
one of the clerks in the India-House, whose error "was
not his first" of the kind, yet whose Report was ordered,
it has confidently been asserted, by only some one or
two of the whole Court of Directors. In Mr. Sherson's
case again the Board of Controul has compelled the
erasure, from a despatch of the Court of Directors, of
a paragraph recommendatory of an investigation into
the conduct (on this Mr. Sherson's trial) of no less a
person than Sir Francis Macnaghten, the <i>second</i> of
three Judges, of whom the <i>third</i> is almost as much
concerned as Sir Francis himself.</p>

<p>Nor let these parallels be thought to beg the question,
since they might readily have been extended;
and since Major Hart's case would prove itself in
Courts of Law, whether by artful confessions, or by
other and better description of testimony. Unhappily,
however, the period for this is expired.</p>

and might have been a ground of thanks; but who would

incorrect, viz. an Act of Parliament, and the one cited on
what are called the Mandamus Papers!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> In the debate on the Mandamus Papers, a proprietor
of stock asks, "What did Lord Ellenborough say? Did he
say, that what was done was conclusive evidence of any
bargain having been made, or any price being charged? No;
Lord Ellenborough said,&mdash;No; he is ordered to enter it as
an item of account; but that does not give it the character
of having been purchased for the public. He acquiesces in
the direction to enter it; but it ought to be considered as
if he had not so entered and as if it stood in its original
situation." But we must ask, what would Lord Ellenborough
have said, had his lordship been informed that the
fraud was not solely in Major Hart's grain, but, also, in
that of Captain Macleod, and who, <i>previously to the discovery
of the fraud</i>, had been ordered, by Lord Harris, to
enter, that is, to retain his benjarries, now called, private
grain, for "the <i>public</i> service." Of Major Hart's grain,
it can equally be observed, that this had also been publicly
returned in Captain Macleod's Report, which Report has
been stated to close thus: "<i>it is supposed</i> Major Hart has
7000 bullock-loads, which would be ten seers each to
30,000 men. (Signed) William Macleod, Superintendant of
Supplies."</p></div>
